Known bug(s):
! Collisions between the player and inner corner walls result in undefined behaviour. 
! Holding shift and going to any collidable object may result in undefined behaviour.

! Door animations may spaz out when entering new room

NOTE: Due to time constraints some of the rooms are unfinished
